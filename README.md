# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮✊🖐✌️

A classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in Python as part of Day 4 of the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.

This was a fun project where I practiced:
- User input handling
- Conditional logic (`if-elif-else`)
- Random module usage
- List indexing
- Displaying ASCII art

---

## 💡 Features

- ASCII visuals for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- Randomized computer opponent using `random.randint()`.
- Validates user input to prevent errors.
- Clear win/loss/tie logic using conditionals.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to type `0` for Rock, `1` for Paper, or `2` for Scissors.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The chosen options are displayed using ASCII art.
4. The winner is determined and printed.
5. Invalid inputs are caught and result in a loss.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to work with Python lists and indices.
- How to validate user input.
- How to use logical operators to evaluate game conditions.
- How to represent game objects visually with ASCII.
